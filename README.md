## Features

- `ping`: view your current network latency
- `back`: return to your last death location or position before a teleport
- `tpa`: send teleport requests between players and accept/deny them
- `warp`: manage named warp points (tp/add/remove/list)
- `home`: manage personal homes (tp/add/remove)
